# Two-Face Inpainting
Two-Face Inpainting consists of a Machine Learning model capable of reconstructing missing regions of facial images. The model takes as input the masked image and a reference image from the same person (thus the name Two-Face Inpainting), and generates the missing region on the masked image. The project also has a [Web Application](https://github.com/gsnaider/two-face-web-client) for testing the model with any facial image.
Two-Face Inpainting was implemented as my final project for the Software Engineering degree at the University of Buenos Aires.
